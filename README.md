## GA Project Requirements (MVP)

- Working full-stack application, using MERN stack: 
    -- MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
- MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers (Note: React is views)
- At least one model with full CRUD
- At least three react components, besides App.js
- Deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
- Two git repositories, one for backend and one for frontend
- A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes
- Links to hosted and working apps

## Project Stretch Goals

- Wireframing (created via Figma)
- CSS
- React routing


## Future Goals
These are additions I wasn't able to get to within project timeframe, but want to implement in the future!

- Model: Plant
    - `petFriendly: { type: Boolean }` (possibly based on toxicity level)
    - `maintenance: { type: "High" | "Medium" | "Low" }` (possibly based on hardiness)
    - `waterSched: { type: Number }` (possibly based on drought/humidity resistance)
- API: It was difficult to find a public plant API that worked for my project. Hoping to expand on this later on.
- Search functionality for user added plants
- Upcoming Tasks React component
- User image upload via Cloudinary
