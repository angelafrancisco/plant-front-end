## Project Requirements (MVP)

- A working full-stack application, using the MERN stack: 
    -- Node.js, Mongoose, Express and React.
- Adhere to the MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers (Note, in this case views is React in it's own separate repository; there will not be an actual views directory in your Express backend)
- At least one model with full CRUD.
- At least three react components, defined in their own files, besides App.js.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
- Two git repositories, one for backend and one for frontend.
- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
- Have links to your hosted and working apps in the README.md files in your GitHub repos.
